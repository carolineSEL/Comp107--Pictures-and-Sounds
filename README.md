This repository is a collection of projects from the Comp 107 Pictures and Sounds course at Kalamazoo College. The assignments in the repository were written in Python using the Jython software, which is where they were tested and where you can run the code. 

The purpose of these assignments was to practice, learn, and demonstrate basic coding principles in Python, by editing picture and sound files using Jython java libraries provided by Jython.
